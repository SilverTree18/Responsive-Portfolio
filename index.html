						<p>Welcome to my page! For the past 14 years, I have been a yearbook representative. I started working on yearbooks in high school and was able to continue on in college. My senior year of college, I was sad to create my final yearbook until I realized I could make it into my fulltime job. After college, I moved to the Chicago area for seven years before a position opened in my homestate of Minnesota. My job is to visit schools throughout the area and help them create their yearbook. It's a lot of fun creating something that people will cherish forever. Because of this, I am an expert in Indesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. I have developed a great eye when it comes to proofing pages which is a great skill when you write code. I'm excited to use my design skills to create websites. </p>
